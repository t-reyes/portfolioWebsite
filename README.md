Overview
In this project I will create a functional and stylize website. There will be one main page that will have 3 sections, welcome, projects, and hobbies. The welcome section will display when the webpage is first launched. It will display some basic information about me and include my resume. The project section will display some of the projects I have worked on. The hobbies section will be for other things I find interesting.
